# JavaScript-A-Z-Notes
This is everything you need to know about the lanuguage of the future, Javascript!

## 🎯 Purpose
This is my attempt at sharing JS knowledge with everyone, even those who might not have the time to go through all the videos. Also, I will use this repo for quick reference to JS concepts when necessary. I made the mistake of writing notes on pen and paper while doing the Machine Learning course by AndrewNG and now its collecting 🕸️. Figured this would be a better way of documenting my journey 🔥

## 💗 Contributions
If you have notes of your own, and are interested in contributing to this repo, hit a PR! I'll review it and add it immediately 🤓

## 📝 Resource Used 
Namaste 🙏 JavaScript course by the legendary Akshay Saini
